FINANCIAL EVENTS

Positive

You were walking down the street when you found a $600,000 bill. Good luck finding change for that one!

While you were sitting on a restaurant patio eating lunch, someone mistook you for a beggar and dropped $100 in your cup of soda. Poor personal hygiene really CAN pay off!

You found a $100 bill in your pants pocket! Well, it wasn't really in your pocket, really, and it was in someone else's pocket, but what's the difference?

Your money counterfeiting operation is in full swing; You get $10,000! Just don't use those bills at the bank!


Negative

Someone stole $200 from your pocket and you couldn't chase them down! Maybe if you ran more often...

Your car started billowing black smoke on the way to work, and it's completely kaput. You have to buy a new car, and you don't roll with cheap wheels; you lose $80,000.

Time for your weekly tithe. You lose $20,000, but gain eternal salvation!

On the way home from the opera, a mugger hit you over the head with a rolling pin and made off with your wallet. You lose $40,000. Maybe you shouldn't carry so much cash in your wallet!

Your identity has been compromised; someone took $100,000 out of your bank account! Sony really needs to beef up their security...


MARRIAGE

Positive

You really married into a wealthy family! You get $200,000 for your stocking stuffer this Christmas.
